1. ADAMA_Models (On BlueHive) [/scratch/tolugboj_lab/Prj5_HarnomicRFTraces/2_Data/ADAMA_Models] <br>
<br>
INCLUDES: 
* ADAMA_1D.mat: the ADAMA 1D models (note some of the field is empty because there is no update)
* Litho_1D.mat: the Litho1.0 1D models (same order as the ADAMA_1D and the AfrDownSampleDots)
* AfrDownSampleDots.mat: location of the downsampled points in Africa, and the corresponding index in the map (afrmask; set how to use it in the plotting code fig7_VelMesmQlt.m) 

2. ADAMA_Maps  (On BlueHive) [/scratch/tolugboj_lab/Prj5_HarnomicRFTraces/2_Data/ADAMA_Maps] <br>
<br>
INCLUDES: 
* RCellVelDist: Rayleigh maps cell and velocity distribution (Fig. 3)
* LCellVelDist: Love maps cell and velocity distribution (Fig. 3)
* RayAvgMap: Rayleigh velocity maps, group and phase
* LoveAvgMap: Love velocity maps, group and phase
* AfrDownSampleDots.mat: location of the downsampled points in Africa, and the corresponding index in the map (afrmask; set how to use it in the plotting code fig7_VelMesmQlt.m)
